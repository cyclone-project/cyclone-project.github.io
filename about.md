## Overview

CYCLONE is a [Horizon 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) innovation action funded by the European Commission which aims at integrating existing cloud management software to allow a unified management of federated clouds.

CYCLONE integrates Network-as-a-Service, application deployment, service access managmenet as well as end-to-end security solutions. The integration will be validated in diverse application areas, such as bioinformatics, high-energy physics, and cloud application service provisioning.

## Objectives

Both academic and commercial application service providers have embraced Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud infrastructures because of their elasticity, flexibility, and dynamic resource provisioning.  These application service providers have moved beyond simple, single-machine applications and now develop complex computing platforms that are deployed and maintained within the cloud.

These complex applications are often distributed between cloud infrastructures to provide resilience against cloud provider outages, higher levels of elasticity, and better response times for their users by placing services near the clients.  Moreover, they are often designed to scale automatically in response to demand and to permit live upgrades of the underlying software.

The CYCLONE project primarily targets application service providers who develop complex computing platforms and deploy them on cloud infrastructures.  One often finds these application service providers in innovative SMEs and institutes that want to take advantage of the cloud’s dynamic nature to deliver responsive, adaptable services to their users.

CYCLONE’s software and tools will:

 * Facilitate the deployment, management, and use of complex, multi-cloud applications, and
 * Enhance the end-to-end security of those applications.

The project integrates and improves existing, production-quality tools to achieve this aim.

The project partners have identified two flagship domains: academic use cases for bioinformatics research and use cases for a commercial deployment for smart grids in the energy sector.  These will guide the initial development of the tools. Additional use cases, selected during the course of the project, will highlight missing, critical features and guide the evolution of the software.

These will guide the initial development of the tools. Additional use cases, selected during the course of the project, will highlight missing, critical features and guide the evolution of the software.

The project adopts agile software processes, notably SCRUM, to ensure that:

 * The project delivers production quality code that is thoroughly and systematically tested.
 * The needs of the real-world use cases are well covered by the CYCLONE features.
 * Features for deploying and maintaining running cloud applications are provided.
 * The project can respond to new opportunities by rapidly re-focusing development effort.
 * Constantly maintains a working version of the CYCLONE tools and platform.

The project’s distributed testbed will play a critical role, enabling the full, continuous validation of the software before the foreseen production deployments on a federated bioinformatics cloud. This process will also allow CYCLONE to measure the technical progress of the project through tickets attached to work items for each development iteration (“sprint”) along with progress summaries of each sprint.

Concretely, the project will:

 * Improve cloud services in the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) layer by integrating network services into the cloud offering, allowing direct control over virtual machine network accessibility, intra-site data access, and inter-site data transfers.
 * Develop tools that provide enhanced functionality for cloud providers that agree to federate their resources, such as dynamic allocation of bandwidth between cloud providers and common authentication mechanisms.
 * Provide tools that allow application developers to take advantage of features like VM coordination within deployments, automated placement of service components, and scaling of service components, essentially providing them with the means to develop a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering.
 * The means to deploy and to manage easily the defined applications to allow the application service provides to maintain Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) systems.
 * Provide software that allows developers to ensure the end-to-end, secure use of data within their application as well as secured access to remote data sources.
 * Demonstrate that the CYCLONE software meets the needs of concrete academic and commercial use cases, while providing frequent, production-quality releases of that software.

These objectives address a number of deficiencies of the current cloud ecosystem from which application service providers and developers suffer:

 * Distributed applications, by definition, rely heavily on network services.  However, the network features of most cloud infrastructures are rudimentary and not fully integrated with the other cloud management services.
 * Control of network resources between data centers through the cloud APIs is currently impossible.
 * Application monitoring, deployment manipulation, auto-scaling, and network provisioning are critical for complex application management, yet these features are rudimentary or completely lacking from application deployment tools.
 * Lack of a unified identity management scheme between cloud providers forces application service providers to manage a variety of credentials, often in suboptimal ways that reduce the security of the overall application deployment.
 * Mechanisms for the secure, end-to-end management of sensitive data are not incorporated in either the cloud software or the application deployment tools.
