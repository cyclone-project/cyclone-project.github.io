title: The Second CYCLONE Newsletter available 
teaser: Explore our use case scenarios and how we provide security to federated cloud applications.

In [the second CYCLONE newsletter](/assets/images/newsletters/CYCLONE Newsletter second edition.pdf) 
we present the security requirements and challenges for application deployment that are addressed
by the CYCLONE development. The CYCLONE project partners have identified two flagship domains: academic
use cases for bioinformatics research and use cases for a commercial platform for future energy management. Both
use cases deal with highly distributed and fragmented application space. Based on use case scenarios described at
CYCLONE deliverables, challenging security requirements were drafted. We first present how CYCLONE development
addresses Bioinformatics use case security requirements. Next, the main components of the CYCLONE security
architecture are described. We also present the security requirements derived from the Energy use case.
Besides, in this newsletter, we presented access control infrastructure provisioning within CYCLONE.
