#### CYCLONE presented a poster and a demo at the TNC17 Conference

CYCLONE presented a poster titled "CYCLONE Networking Architecture for Multi-cloud Applications", by Eduard Escalona, Albert Viñés (I2CAT), and other project members, was presented at
the GEANT/TERENA Networking Conference TNC17, 29 May – 2 June 2017, Linz, Austria.
The TNC15 conference is the primer event for European networking community that is increasingly adopting cloud based technologies for building SDN and NFV based network infrastructure provisioned on demand.
TNC17 was attended by more that 500 attendees from Europe, US and Asia Pacific region.

The poster presents implementation of the network management functionality and tools in the virtualised multi-cloud environment developed as a part of the CYCLONE project. The paper introduces the CYCLONE architecture that represents general use case for multi-cloud applications deployment using cloud automation that motivates need for intercloud network infrastructure provisioning for applications that involve multi-cloud computing and data resources. The paper describes the proposed solution the CYCLONE Network Services Manager and Orchestrator (CNSMO), which is the software component responsible of deploying, configuring and running the networking services in cloud applications. CNSMO is a lightweight micro-services framework developed by the i2CAT Foundation. CNSMO is based on the SDN paradigm, implementing an overlay network that will exploit the underlying connectivity given by ISPs. Such overlay allows application providers to configure, modify and monitor the networking behavior of virtual machines independently of the inter- and intra-Cloud network (but inheriting the ISP SLAs). CYCLONE’s networking solution multi-cloud since it is specially designed for distributed scenarios where the virtual machines live in different data centers building a multi-domain hybrid cloud.
