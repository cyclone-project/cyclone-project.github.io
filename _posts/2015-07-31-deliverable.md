CYCLONEâ€™s software and tools aim to facilitate the deployment, management and use of complex multi-cloud applications and to enhance the end-to-end security of those applications. The provided tools with the appropriate extensions will support the configuration of the cloud applications, its automated deployment onto cloud infrastructures, and control of the allocated cloud resources. For the testing purpose of these tools and software and as a reference implementation, a testbed is necessary to be set up and deployed. The CYCLONE testbed will play a critical role, enabling the full, continuous validation of the software before the foreseen production deployments on a federated cloud.
