---
The CYCLONE consortium was represented by José Aznar (i2CAT) in the Inter-Cloud Cluster meeting on “Issues motivations and challenges” that took place in Brussels during the 19th of April. In this meeting, it was summarized the whitepaper as major collaborative outcome of all projects of the cluster and the next steps were identified.
Regarding CYCLONE, <!-- more -->the project was presented to the other projects’ representatives attending to the event. Several discussions with BEACON project representatives (Massimo Villari and Philippe Massonet) were driven. BEACON is a project focussed on Cloud networking so that the focus of the discussion was specifically on Cloud networking techniques considered in both projects. CYCLONE will keep monitoring the activity of BEACON and it was agreed the possibility of arranging short-term collaborations among the projects.
