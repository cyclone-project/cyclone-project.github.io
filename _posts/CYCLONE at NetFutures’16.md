title: CYCLONE at NetFutures’16

---
We attended to the NetFutures’16 event during the 20th and 21st of April in Brussels. 
On the 20th we participated in the CloudWATCH2 Unit E2 Concertation meeting where it was explained most relevant figures of last Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2016 - 2017 call submissions, highlighting the large amount of projects submitted. Most relevant outcomes from the different Unit clusters were provided as well. 
During the 20th and 21st, <!-- more -->one of the recent cloud networking demos (the VPN network service for cloud federated scenarios) was also shown in the inter-cloud cluster booth in the exhibition area. The demo created interest among the curious onlookers and several comments and feedback was received.
