The objectives of the proposed networking session are:
* to discuss the current level of Cloud adoption;
* strengths and weaknesses of the Cloud computing technology today;
* opportunities and threats in relation to reaching the Digital Single Market.

It intends to respond to a growing role and acceptance of the Cloud Computing technologies in Europe. The use of Cloud computing technology may have substantial impact on creating innovative applications and large job markets in Europe and across the World.

EU has adopted Digital Single Market Strategy that includes a set of targeted actions and is built on three pillars:
(1) better access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe;
(2) creating the right conditions and a level playing field for digital networks and innovative services to flourish;
(3) maximising the growth potential of the digital economy.
