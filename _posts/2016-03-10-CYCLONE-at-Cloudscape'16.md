We presented a poster at Cloudscape 2016 (http://www.cloudscapeseries.eu), a Cloud event that took place on 8-9 March in 
Brussels, Belgium.

The poster provided an overview of CYCLONE in general and illustrated two Bioinformatics usecases considered in the project. 
The first usecase sketched the steps of deployment of an application to CYCLONE managed cloud that is used to analyse human 
medical data. The second usecase illustrated how a cloud federation formed with CYCLONE can be used to analyse large amounts 
of microbial data. 

A high level roadmap together with the contributed components for building the framework considered in CYCLONE has 
also been presented in the poster.
