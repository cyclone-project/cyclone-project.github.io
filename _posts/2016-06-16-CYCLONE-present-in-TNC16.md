title: CYCLONE present in TNC’16
---

The CYCLONE project was represented by i2CAT during the past TNC’16 (Prague- Czech Republic) by demonstrating the OpenNaaS-CNSMO software and the 3 implemented network services: The VPN, the Firewall and the Load Balancer.  A great number of people stopped by at i2CAT’s booth and the three demos were explained and demonstrated, receiving several comments and feedback.  Most interesting received feedback was <!-- more -->related to the benefits of shaping network services for cloud federation environments and the utilization and integration of already mature software solutions to compose the CYCLONE solution. The utilization of container technologies (Docker in this case) was also of the network service features highlighted by the audience.
