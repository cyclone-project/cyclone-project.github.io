Consistent security design requires security developers and application developers to interact at the early stage of the systems and services design to make right designing about future integration process security and access control policy development. This two-days very intensive meeting allowed to clarify many important issues about security standards, tools, platforms, practices and make initial decisions about future security architecture (to be delivered in D4.1 in M12). Number of issues was indicated for future discussion. Planning for the first CYCLONE demonstration has been also discussed at the meeting.
