#### ESnet Releases Open Source Software from MyESnet Portal for Building Online Interactive Network Portals 

ESnet is making available the software to create multi-domain network maps.
OCTOBER 2, 2015

By making the libraries available, the team hopes that other organizations will take the code, use it, 
add to it and work with ESnet to make the improvements available to the community. “Ideally, other folks will 
come up with new and interesting ways to look at their data since they don’t need to re-create the visualizations 
these libraries provide.

When ESnet, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Energy Sciences Network, unveiled its online interactive network 
portal called MyESnet in July of 2011, the reaction was strongly positive – other research and education networks 
liked it so much, they wanted the code to create their own portals.

After four years of development and refinement, they will get their wish. On Oct. 5, Jon Dugan of ESnet’s Tool Team 
will give a presentation on “ESnet’s Network Visualization Toolkit” at the 2015 Technology Exchange conference 
in Cleveland, Ohio. About 500 network experts from around the world are expected to attend the meeting.

The idea to develop the libraries grew out of the strong desire from the community to leverage the portal 
software for their own networks. The problem was that the portal itself was strongly tied to the way ESnet
works and it wasn’t clear how to make it general enough for others to use. Instead of open sourcing the entire
 portal, the team decided to focus on factoring out the general purpose pieces and open sourcing those. 
 Breaking out the general purpose code also made the remaining portal code cleaner and easier to maintain. 
 “We did a lot of this for our own sanity,” Dugan said with a smile.

There are three reusable pieces that are being made available now as open source:
* Time Series Charts Library
* Network Diagram Library
* Pond (unifying time series abstraction)

The charting library and the network diagrams library are built using React, an open-source library for 
creating user interfaces developed by Facebook in JavaScript.
