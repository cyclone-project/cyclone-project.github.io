CYCLONE presentation explained the constraint programming approach for the service matching problem on cloud marketplaces and multi-cloud application deployment scenarios. This work will be the base for the service matching in the CYCLONE context.

The presentation took place on the 16th of June. The audience was composed of both acedemia and industry members. They provided valuable feedback and questions, and showed interest in the further investigation of the multi-cloud context for service matching. We also had the chance to discuss with other EU funded projects which implement service matching focused on security parameters.
