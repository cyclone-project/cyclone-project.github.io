CYCLONE will partner with the GEANT4 project to co-organise the 5th [Intercloud2016 Workshop ](/intercloud2016.html) as part of the  IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E) that will be held on April 4-8, 2016 in Berlin, Germany

#### Scope and Objective

The workshop is a follow-up of the successful workshops held in 2013-2015 (in conjunction with the IC2E conference) that gathered a number researchers and developers dealing with developing architecture  and components of the complex multi-cloud and multi-provider applications and infrastructure services. 

Advancement in Cloud Computing technologies and increasing adoption of clouds by enterprises motivated development of new concepts, models and architectures in Cloud Computing such as intercloud, federated cloud, federated clouds and cloud automation tools and platforms. That in its own turn creates a basis for the Big Data and Data intensive technologies. Cloud Computing from Cloud Service Providers is a burgeoning market with a wide variety to choose from, including some of the most notable names in Internet and IT today. Cloud Computing is the go-to platform now for datacenter architecture, scalable application hosting, new application development, and mobile app platform. While cloud Computing enjoys a certain amount of application – or application architecture – portability, there are not really any interoperability standards or common practices in place. Security, SLA, and other concerns are still active areas of interest. Also, while Cloud Computing is different from Grid Computing, there is some Federation and Interoperability in the Grid community, are these appropriate to the Cloud Computing space. It is widely believed that the whole space of Clouds, Grids, and the Intercloud will federate and eventually converge. There are lessons to be learned from the early Internet work as well as Mobile Telephony. Some believe that SDN is the key to making this happen. This workshop focuses on techniques, experiences and lessons learned for interoperable services in Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability. This workshop aims at providing a forum to bring together researchers for sharing and exchanging Cloud computing related research, technologies, experience, and lessons for building Clouds with Intercloud, Multicloud, Federation, and Interoperability capabilities and services.
