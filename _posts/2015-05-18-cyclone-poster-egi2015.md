The poster introduced the CYCLONE project multi-cloud applications deployment and management platform and ecosystem 
that offers benefits of integrating heterogeneous public and private cloud applications and resources with dynamically 
deployed advanced inter-cloud network services provisioning on-demand and federated security infrastructure.
CYCLONE project targets ASPs, providing them with software and tools that facilitate the deployment and 
management of complex multi-cloud applications and enhance the end-to-end security and network management of 
multi-cloud applications.

CYCLONE research and development is focused on the following tasks and services:

- Improving cloud IaaS services by integrating network services into the cloud offering for a direct control 
over virtual machine network accessibility, intra-site data access, and inter-site data transfers, including 
dynamic allocation of bandwidth between cloud providers and common authentication mechanisms.

- Creating software tools and components that allows developers to ensure the end-to-end security, including 
secure data access and transfer as well as dynamically provisioned access control infrastructure.

- Providing tools for application developers to automate the placement of service components, scale resources 
toward a full-featured PaaS and SaaS offerings.

- Further developing the concept of the Marketplace as a Third Party Trusted services for cloud services and 
applications publishing and discovery in market oriented multi-provider environment.

CYCLONE integrates and improves existing open-source components contributed by the project partners: 

* SlipStream web-based and API tool for defining complex, multi-machine applications and automating their 
deployment onto cloud infrastructures (SixSq) 

* StratusLab software distribution and deployment for IaaS cloud (CNRS)

* OpenNaaS Network-as-a-Service platform (I2CAT)

* Trusted Cloud Transfer Protocol (TCTP) (TUB)

* Dynamic Access Control Infrastructure (DACI) (UvA)
