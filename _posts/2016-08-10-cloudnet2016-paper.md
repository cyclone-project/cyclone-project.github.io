The position paper “CYCLONE: a Multi-Cloud Federation Platform For Complex Bioinformatics And Energy Applications” will present the CYCLONE architecture and describe the project approach to integratig network infrastructure and cloud based applications.

Paper Abstract:

Multi-cloud applications delivered across heterogeneous public cloud service providers poses different
technical and operational challenges in terms of resource brokering,
integration, implementation of security trusts, etc.. In this paper we
describe the federation approach taken in the H2020 CYCLONE
project, which designed a multi-cloud platform integrating and
orchestrating different open-source cloud and network management
tools (Openstack, OpenNaaS, SlipStream and TCTP). Some real-life
use-cases in the scientific area of energy optimization and
bioinformatics are in use to validate the CYCLONE architecture and
integrated platform, from the viewpoints of service deployment,
service availability, elasticity and security. These validation activities are carried out in the CYCLONE shared testbed infrastructure,
whose high-level description is also presented in this paper. Initial
feedbacks on the validation of the CYCLONE federation approach
will be available at the beginning of Q4-2016, when the CYCLONE
use-case portfolio will be extended to increase external users’
involvement and attempt validation of the federation approach from
real world market
