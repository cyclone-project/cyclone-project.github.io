The paper is focused on optimisation of resources allocated to user applications that are demployed and managed by the CYCLONE platform.

Paper Abstract:

This  paper presents  results  of the ongoing  development of the CYCLONE as  a platform for scientific applications in heterogeneous 
multi-cloud/multi-provider environment. In particular, we focus  on QoS management  of the multi- cloud applications  within CYCLONE. 
A challenging factor for application deployment and exploitation within the CYCLONE infrastructure  is its highly dynamic nature, which 
raises the need for control  methods that quickly adapt to – or even anticipate to –  changing  circumstances.  
In  this paper we present  the solution that allows for performance optimization of the running applications  within CYCLONE.  
This solution  is  envisioned  as an eternal  software solution which can be integrated with SlipStream, a cloud automation and management platform. Based on the analysis of the measurement  data, a number of actions may be taken. These actions may include 
re-scaling of the cloud resources,  re-deployment  of the application, or choosing of the alternative deployment of the same application.  
The core of our solution  is  the analytics  engine,  and, for a given  scenario,  we illustrate the some of the engine algorithms.
