The paper will present the CYCLONE project vision about multi-cloud and inter-cloud applications deployment automation.

Paper Abstract:
Various Cloud layers have to work in concert in order to manage and deploy complex multicloud applications, executing 
sophisticated workflows for Cloud resource deployment, activation, adjustment, interaction, and monitoring. While there 
are ample solutions for managing individual Cloud aspects (e.g. network controllers, deployment tools, and application 
security software), there are no well integrated
suites for managing the entire Cloud stack, especially within multi-cloud and multi-provider scenarios.

The paper presents the CYCLONE architecture that integrates a number of existing solutions to create a unified, 
holistic Cloud management platform for single- and multi-cloud applications, tailored to the needs of research 
organizations and SMEs. It discusses major challenges in providing a network and security infrastructure for 
the Intercloud and concludes with the demonstration how the architecture is
implemented in a real life bioinformatics use case.
