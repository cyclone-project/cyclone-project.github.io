title: CYCLONE organizes the Intercloud2016 workshop
---
#### CYCLONE chaired the workshop and presented a position paper at the 5th Intercloud2016 workshop collocated with IC2E Conference on 4-8 April 2016 in Berlin
CYCLONE member Ilke Zilci (TUB) presented the paper with the title "CYCLONE: A Platform for Data Intensive Scientific Applications in Heterogeneous Multi-cloud/Multiprovider environment" on 4th of April. The workshop brought together multicloud researchers and industry by combining paper presentations and a tutorial on Nuvla.

The paper is focused on use cases analysis and definition of requirements to the main CYCLONE platform components to enable multi-cloud and inter-cloud applications deployment automation. It presents results of the ongoing development of the CYCLONE as a platform for scientific applications in heterogeneous multi-cloud/multi-provider environment. The paper starts with the general use case that motivates the CYCLONE architecture and provides detailed analysis of the bioinformatics use cases that define specific requirements to the CYCLONE infrastructure components. Special attention is given to the federated access control and security infrastructure that must provide consistent security and data protection for distributed bioinformatics data processing infrastructure and distributed cross-organisations collaborating teams of scientists. Moreover, the multi cloud application deployment performed using Nuvla demonstrates the practical benefits of CYCLONE to the bioinformatics community.

With a very good level of participation, all presenters and their teams were present at the workshop. We had fruitful discussions and exchanged ideas for future collaboration. The first talk was the rpesentation of the CYCLONE paper. The audience paid special attention to its positioning and how to use it. A selection of the questions asked are: "How are the API keys of different clouds managed?, How do you compare Nuvla to Chef and puppet with regards to value proposition? and Neutron vs. OpenNaas on network management capabilities?" The questions demonstrate that the CYCLONE components tackle practical problems and aim to extend the state of the art tools.

Finally, CYCLONE member Rob Branchat(SixSq) presented the capabilities of Nuv.la. The audience was especially interested in multi cloud multi component deployment.

Furthermore, we had talks on the following topics: Virtual organizations in Keystone of Open Stack, NIST and open group reference models for cloud architecture, cost models for distributed clouds, zero touch network configuration related to GEANT poject.

CYCLONE thanks all the presenters for their valueable contributions, especially Sonja Filiposka for co-chairing the workshop.
