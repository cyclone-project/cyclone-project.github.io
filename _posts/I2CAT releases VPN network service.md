---

I2CAT team in collaboration with SixSq released the first stable version of the VPN cloud networking service. The service has been implemented with the OpenNaaS- Cyclone Network Services Manager/ Orchestrator (CNSMO) and integrated as an application within the Nuvla appliance. The service provides with VPN connectivity among the application deployed VMs in order to secure the connection among them despite being in distant DCs. The VPN demonstrator was shown during the last Netfuturesâ€™16 event. Based on the OpenNaaS-CNSMO platform the plan is to shortly release additional network services to be used by the CYCLONE project use cases.
