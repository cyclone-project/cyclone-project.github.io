title: SlipStream Training for CYCLONE Participants

---

[SixSq](http://sixsq.com/) provided a day-long tutorial on
[SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/) for CYCLONE
members after the project's recent Face-to-Face collaboration meeting
in Amsterdam.  Six people took advantage of the training and learned
about how to use SlipStream to:

 * Deploy simple and complex applications on cloud infrastructures, 
 * Define portable, multi-cloud applications, and
 * Scale those applications horizontally and vertically.

The participants used the project's testbed consisting of
[Nuvla](https://nuv.la/) and the StratusLab and OpenStack clouds at
the [Laboratoire de l'Accélérateur Linear
(LAL)](http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/) as well as the [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.ch)
public cloud. The testbed will soon include cloud resources from
[QSC](https://www.qsc.de/de/) and
[Interoute](http://www.interoute.com), two other CYCLONE partners.

[i2cat](http://www.i2cat.net/en) has developed generic VPN and
Firewall components that can be easily added to applications defined
in SlipStream.  These allow application developers to secure their
applications without having to reimplement these fundamental
components.  The i2cat developers learned in the tutorial how to speed
the deployment of these components and how to adapt them
(e.g. scaling) as a cloud application evolves over time.

If you're interested in SlipStream features, you can sign-up for an
account on [Nuvla](https://nuv.la), follow the embedded tour, and
learn more with the [online
tutorial](http://ssdocs.sixsq.com/en/latest/advanced_tutorial/index.html).
