#### CYCLONE Federation Provider is Online!

CYCLONE project team from TU Berlin wired the [CYCLONE Federation Provider](http://federation.cyclone-project.eu/) to [eduGAIN](http://services.geant.net/edugain/Pages/Home.aspx). It allows cloud application users to log in to CYCLONE services with their accounts at the member identity providers of eduGAIN.

Cloud application developers can use [CYCLONE Federation Provider](http://federation.cyclone-project.eu/) to test their integration using the preconfigured clients. Our documentation describes the steps to integrate with the federation provider following the Authorization Code Flow of OpenID Connect. CYCLONE provides also the code and the configuration for three demo applications:

- [Using Apache OpenID Connect Module](https://github.com/cyclone-project/cyclone-federation-provider-apache-oidc-demo)
- [A Ruby on Rails application using the Omniauth Openid Connect Library](https://github.com/TU-Berlin-SNET/tresor-demo)
- [WordPress with Generic OpenId Connect Plugin](https://github.com/cyclone-project/cyclone-demo-wp-docker) 

Moreover, the [CYCLONE Github Repository](https://github.com/cyclone-project/cyclone-federation-provider) provides the Federation Provider as a Docker image description for quick local test installations.
