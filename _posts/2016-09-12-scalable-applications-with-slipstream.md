#### Facilitating application deployment to the cloud

As part of its involvement in the H2020 CYCLONE project, the SixSq team has been working hard to develop sophisticated placement 
and ranking features within SlipStream.

#### What is the Placement and Ranking Service?

The Placement and Ranking Service within SlipStream allows policy-based selection of cloud infrastructures when deploying applications. 
This service compares application requirements against detailed cloud capability information in the Service Catalog to select viable
cloud infrastructures for the application. The service will then rank the results according to estimated price.

If you would like to read more about the Service Catalog and automated cloud application placement, take a look at our blog.

#### Why is this useful?

This feature is attractive to both end users and application developers. End users can select a cloud based on a number of criteria 
including pricing, geographical location, availablility, and capacity.

It also allows developers to specify a placement policy for application components, for example, limiting where a component can run 
to meet certain data protection requirements.

By automating the selection process, users can save time when deploying applications while still meeting their placement criteria. 
More interestingly, this enables fully automated scaling of applications to optimize the resource usage when demand for the application rises and falls.

SixSq is now exploiting this service to describe the different Service Level Agreements of the services shown in the service catalog so users can find the right cloud for their requirements quickly and systematically. Such a tool is paramount in regulated industries such finance and pharmaceuticals, and builds a robust audit trail from decision to delivery. In the case of CYCLONE, the feature is put to good test by the existing energy and bioinformatics use cases. New use cases planned for the last half of the project will test this feature more thoroughly.
