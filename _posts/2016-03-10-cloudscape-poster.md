\f0\fs24 \cf0 CYCLONE @ Cloudscape\
\
We presented a poster at Cloudscape 2016 (http://www.cloudscapeseries.eu), a Cloud event that took place on 8-9 March in Brussels, Belgium.\
\
The poster provided an overview of CYCLONE in general and illustrated two Bioinformatics usecases considered in the project. The first usecase sketched the steps of deployment of an application to CYCLONE managed cloud that is used to analyse human medical data. The second usecase illustrated how a cloud federation formed with CYCLONE can be used to analyse large amounts of microbial data. A high level roadmap for building the framework considered in CYCLONE has also been presented in the poster.}
