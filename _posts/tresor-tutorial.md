The tutorial took place onlin eon 14 April 2015. 
The TRESOR Ecosystem uses Claims-based Identities for consistent and secure federated authentication. 
The current implementation follows the Guide to Claims-Based Identity and Access Control and uses 
Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services. It is comparable to the Federated Identity with 
Multiple Partners scenario.

For authorization, the TRESOR Ecosystem uses the TRESOR XACML Policy Decision Point, which is based 
on the WSO2 Balana Engine.
