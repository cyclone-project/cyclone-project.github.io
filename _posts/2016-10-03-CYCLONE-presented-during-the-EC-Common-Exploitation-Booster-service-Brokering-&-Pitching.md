Today it took place in the EC premises a workshop to pitch the potential outcomes of CYCLONE project. 
It was a great opportunity to explain the outomes, the problem CYCLONE comes to solve and a basis of the marketing and business models that CYCLONE as a solution could be adopting.
We counted on the feedback an comments from real investors from the EC Business confederation for business angels.
Nice experience, nice feedback...and looking forward to take next steps and enhance current pitching performance.
