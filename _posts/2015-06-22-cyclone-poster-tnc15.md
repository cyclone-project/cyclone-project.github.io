#### CYCLONE presented a poster at the TNC15 Conference

CYCLONE presented a poster titled "CYCLONE: Multi-cloud applications deployment and management platform for research and academic community" 
at the TERENA Networking Conference (TNC15) that is the major event of the European research 
and Education networking community which is one of the CYCLONE target user group. The TNC15 conference took 
place in Porto on 15-18 June 2015 and was attended by more that 600 attendees from Europe, US and Asia 
Pacific region.

Poster abstract is published on the TNC15 Conference website at <https://tnc15.terena.org/core/poster/23>.
The poster introduced the CYCLONE project multi-cloud applications deployment and management platform and ecosystem 
that offers benefits of integrating heterogeneous public and private cloud applications and resources with dynamically 
deployed advanced inter-cloud network services provisioning on-demand and federated security infrastructure.
CYCLONE project targets ASPs, providing them with software and tools that facilitate the deployment and 
management of complex multi-cloud applications and enhance the end-to-end security and network management of 
multi-cloud applications.

CYCLONE Innovation Action project  targets the definition and implementation of a platform for the deployment and management of multi-cloud applications in order to offer the  benefits of integrating heterogeneous public and private cloud applications and resources with dynamically advanced inter-cloud network services, on-demand  provisioning mechanisms and a federated security infrastructure.

Starting from two identified flagship use cases (one academic based on bioinformatics research and one commercial deployment for smart grids in the energy sector) the consortium will guide the project and will highlight missing, critical features. Concretely, the project will:

- Improve cloud IaaS services by integrating network services into the cloud offering for a direct control over virtual machine network accessibility, intra-site data access, and inter-site data transfers, including dynamic allocation of bandwidth between cloud providers and common authentication mechanisms.

- Create software tools and components that allows developers to ensure the end-to-end security, including secure data access and transfer as well as dynamically provisioned access control infrastructure.

- Provide tools for application developers to automate the placement of service components, scale resources toward a full-featured PaaS and SaaS offerings.

- Further develop the concept of the Marketplace as a Third Party Trusted services for cloud services and applications publishing and discovery in market oriented multi-provider environment.

CYCLONE integrates and improves existing production-quality and open-source tools to achieve this aim: 

- SlipStream web-based and API tool for defining complex, multi-machine applications and automating their deployment onto cloud infrastructures (SixSq) 

- StratusLab software distribution and deployment for IaaS cloud (CNRS)

- OpenNaaS Network-as-a-Service platform (I2CAT)

- TRESOR Cloud SaaS security platform and Trusted Cloud Transfer Protocol (TCTP) (TUB)

- Dynamic Access Control Infrastructure (DACI) (UvA)

CYCLONE will integrate Marketplace services available in PlanetLab and TRESOR and will consider additional services to allow their integration with other solutions available from HelixNebula, EGI and GEANT communities.
