The TeleManagement Forum Zero-time Orchestration, Operations and Management (ZOOM) Program

The TeleManagement Forum has created the ZOOM program – Zero-touch Orchestration, Operations and Management 
(also called zero-touch) – to develop Virtualization and NFV & SDN best practices and standards in order to create 
a living blueprint for a new generation of service provider support systems to deliver true business agility and 
new digital services and revenue opportunities.

The TMF webpage is available at <https://www.tmforum.org/zoom/>

The CYCLONE project will cooperate with GEANT4 project (JRA1 activity) to develop Zero-Touch Networking (ZTN) and 
Zero-Touch Cloud Services provisioning concept and architecture model and contribute to TMF standardisation activity.

Initial position will be presented in the joint position paper at
the NetCloud2015 Workshop in conjunction with UCC2015 Conference (<http://cyprusconferences.org/ucc2015/#&panel1-1>).
