## What is CYCLONE?
CYCLONE is a [Horizon 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) innovation action funded by the European Commission which aims at integrating existing cloud management software to allow a unified management of federated clouds.

CYCLONE integrates Network-as-a-Service, application deployment, service access management as well as end-to-end security solutions. The integration will be validated in diverse application areas, such as bioinformatics, high-energy physics, and cloud application service provisioning.

## For service providers

#### Free yourself

CYCLONE frees you from implementing common functionality, such as authentication, authorization or application deployment. You'll implement applications faster, need to maintain less code, and create efficient and robust services more easily.

#### Advance your cloud

The CYCLONE components provide advanced application, network, and data management features out of the box.

#### "Free", as in "free speech"

All CYCLONE components are released under liberal open source licenses.

## For developers and practitioners

#### Better

CYCLONE improves the security and robustness of your favourite cloud applications through common and advanced management functionalities.

#### More

You will see a greater diversity in the cloud, as application developers can concentrate on creativity, instead of menial "plumbing" tasks.

#### Our Benefit

CYCLONE helps to enlarge the European cloud market and thus raises IT employment and tax returns.
