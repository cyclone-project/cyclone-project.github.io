### Summary

Cloud Computing provide ultimate platform for building Big Data infrastructure and running Big Data applications.  However cloud services are in many cases are outsourced to Cloud Services Providers (CSP) and facilities are not under control of companies. Cloud security is the major concern among organisations and individual users when moving data, applications and services to clouds. CSPs put a lot of efforts in developing strong and consistent security framework, adopting federated access control model, and achieving cloud platformsâ€™ compliance with the major general industry specific security standards and regulations.

The tutorial will start with the overview of the basic security and trust management concepts and models as well as key standards defining applications and data security what will provide a basis for discussing security and trust management in clouds and cloud based applications. The tutorial will discuss the major challenges in building consistent security services in cloud and Intercloud environment. A special attention will be given to emerging Intercloud federation models to address such issue as federated collaborative cloud resources and data usage, federated access control and identity management.

The tutorial will look into practical security solutions offered by the major cloud provider platforms such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure with practical examples and demonstration how security and access control services can be configured on both platforms to ensure data security and overall Big Data infrastructure operated in heterogeneous multi-cloud and multi-provider environment. 

The tutorial will provide overview of the security compliance standards and demonstrate a practical example of using CSA Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) for self-assessment of the Cloud Service Provider PCI DSS compliance.
