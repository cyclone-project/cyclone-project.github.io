## Introduction

NetCloud 2016, collocated with IEEE CloudCom 2016, attempts to address the problem of how the underlying network infrastructure is capable of supporting advanced cloud computing use cases, big data power users for an example. The workshop is intended to bring together network research community, commercial network operators and industry with the major cloud computing players, including IT specialists, researchers and commercial providers.

## Topics of interest

* Definition and architectures for the Network as a Service (NaaS) cloud service model and Cloud Carrier operational model
* Intercloud and inter-datacenters Software Defined Networks (SDN)
* Heterogeneous network architectures and frameworks for distributed and high performance computing
* Cloud and Intercloud architecture frameworks and required on-demand network infrastructure provisioning
* Unified and converged IT and optical resources description languages and frameworks for cloud oriented infrastructures
* General Infrastructure services provisioning in clouds, new architecture developments, service delivery and on-demand provisioning frameworks
* Isolation and flexibility of the cloud oriented virtualized optical networks
* Network infrastructure optimization for intra- and inter-datacenter communication and resources virtualisation
* Standardization of optical network service provisioning interfaces for cloud based platforms and services
* Co-advertisement, co-planning, composition and co-provisioning of any type of optical network resource and IT services (i.e. connectivity + IT resources at the end-points coordinated in a single, optimal procedure)
* Performance and reliability issues, Service Level Agreement and QoS guarantees in the network layer
* Dynamically provisioned security infrastructure and its integration with provider and customer legacy services and service provisioning workflow, security policy definition, security context management
* End-to-end techniques for autonomic management of cloud resources
* Policy based infrastructure services management
* Experimental platforms that support network management in cloud computing
* Experimentation test-beds and measurement studies
* Multi-cloud applications and topologies
* OSS/BSS supported solutions for holistic cloud and network self service provisioning
