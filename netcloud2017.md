### Introduction

NetCloud 2017, collocated with IEEE CloudCom 2017, attempts to address the problem of how the underlying network infrastructure is capable of supporting advanced cloud computing use cases, big data power users for an example. The workshop is intended to bring together network research community, commercial network operators and industry with the major cloud computing players, including IT specialists, researchers and commercial providers.

### Topics of interest

* Definition and architectures for the Network as a Service (NaaS) cloud service model and Cloud Carrier operational model
* Intercloud and inter-datacenters Software Defined Networks (SDN)
* Cloud and Intercloud architecture frameworks and required on-demand network infrastructure provisioning
* Unified and converged IT and optical resources description languages and frameworks for cloud oriented infrastructures
* General Infrastructure services provisioning in clouds, new architecture developments, service delivery and on-demand provisioning frameworks
* Isolation and flexibility of the cloud oriented virtualized optical networks
* Standardization of optical network service provisioning interfaces for cloud based platforms and services
* Co-advertisement, co-planning, composition and co-provisioning of any type of optical network resource and IT services (i.e. connectivity + IT resources at the end-points coordinated in a single, optimal procedure)
* Performance and reliability issues, Service Level Agreement and QoS guarantees in the network layer
* End-to-end techniques for autonomic management of cloud resources
* Policy based infrastructure services management
* Experimental platforms that support network management in cloud computing
* Multi-cloud applications and topologies
*	Support systems for holistic cloud and network self service provisioning enabling agile transformation and open market exchange for composed services
*	Network support for fog and dew computing
