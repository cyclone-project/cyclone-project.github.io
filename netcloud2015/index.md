### The 5th workshop on Network Infrastructure Services as part of Cloud Computing (NetCloud 2015)
Webpage: <http://www.cyclone-project.eu/netcloud2015/>

In conjunction with the 8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC2015), 
December 07-10, 2015 – St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

### Introduction	

The workshop is a follow-up of the successful workshop in 2011-2014 (held in conjunction with the CloudCom conference), where a number of enthusiasts of cloud computing and future networking exchanged ideas and presented results of research projects dealing with clouds and network integration.  

The Cloud computing emerges as a new computing paradigm which aims to provide secure and reliable, on demand QoS guaranteed computing environments for the end-users. Cloud computing services usage in both academia and industry, changed the way of thinking on how users’ needs can be satisfied by computational infrastructures. However, with the increase of data transferred among different places, it became critical how to support distributed computing resources with advanced network infrastructure services. It is envisioned that network infrastructure services provisioned on-demand could be managed and reconfigured dynamically by Cloud operators and user applications to achieve optimal usage criteria. Such dynamic infrastructures reveal new aspects in network virtualization, service delivery automation and general infrastructure resources management that should be supported by well-defined information models and related middleware. New components of the required network infrastructure for Cloud services and applications should create an integrated self-management environment that can react to changes in workloads and other events with minimal human interference. Security issues should addressed as a part of the general service delivery framework/workflow and support both infrastructure provisioning process and secure virtualized services/infrastructures operation.

The workshop will address issues of network virtualization to create an ecosystem for cloud computing applications. In particular, the workshop will discuss the progress of development of advanced tools and mechanisms for seamless and efficient integration of network and IT worlds, not well interconnected so far. 
The workshop will consist of a number of sessions, where recent results of on-going and just-finished research projects will be demonstrated. The workshop will present also some future research considerations on the future of cloud computing and networking and expose views from different perspectives: research projects and industry.
The workshop will be followed by a panel discussion, to allow free exchange of thoughts and ideas between the workshop speakers and audience. 

### Objective 

NetCloud2015, collocated with IEEE/ACM UCC2015, attempts to address the problem of how the underlying network infrastructure is capable of supporting advanced cloud computing cases. The workshop is intended to bring together network research community, commercial network operators and industry with the major cloud computing players, including IT specialists, researchers and commercial providers.
