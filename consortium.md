## Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)

<div class="partner_logo">

</div>

The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRSNational Centre for Scientific Research http://www.cnrs.fr) is a government-funded research organization under the administrative authority of the French research ministry.  CNRS, consisting of 1211 laboratories, is the largest fundamental research organization in Europe and is extensively involved in national, European, and international projects covering all fields of knowledge.

The CNRS Ile-de-France Sud Regional Office  (DR4) will be the lead delegation, coordinating and representing the two CNRS Units involved in the project: Institut Français de Bioinformatique (IFB, UMS3601, directed by J.-F. GIBRAT), which is jointly supervised by the Institut National des Sciences Biologiques (INSB) of CNRS, the Institut national de la Recherche Agronomique - INRA, the Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale - Inserm, the Direction des Sciences du Vivant of CEA, the Institut de recherche en sciences du numérique - Inria; and the Laboratoire de l’Accélérateur Linéaire (LAL, UMR8607, directed by Dr. Achille STOCCHI), which is jointly supervised by the University Paris-Sud XI and the Institut National de Physique Nucléaire et de Physique des Particules (IN2P3) of CNRS.

In addition to its physics programme, LAL has extensive experience in scientific computing techniques and infrastructures, participating in major European grid computing projects (European DataGrid and the EGEE series of projects) as well as leading the European StratusLab project that created a complete open-source IaaS cloud distribution.  LAL will lead the technical management of this project and contribute to the tasks related to the improvement of StratusLab and its integration with the networking and other tools within the project’s solution.

The Institut Français de Bioinformatique (IFB or French Institute of Bioinformatics) is a recently created national infrastructure in bioinformatics that originated from a project in response to the “Infrastructures in Biology and Health” call for proposals of the French government “Investment for the Future” initiative. The purpose of IFB is to provide bioinformatics core resources to the national and international life science research community (IFB is the French node of ELIXIR, the European bioinformatics infrastructure).  Among the many tasks required to fulfill this goal, IFB must provide an IT infrastructure devoted to the management and analysis of biological data, in particular data generated by high-throughput technologies. This infrastructure will rely on sizeable hardware resources (high throughput computation, large storage capacity) and will provide access to high-quality developments in terms of software tools and databases. IFB consists of a network of more than 20 bioinformatics platforms gathered into six regional centers that span the French territory and a national hub called IFB-core. In particular, IFB-core is in charge of setting up and running the IFB national IT infrastructure that will be hosted in one of the French national HPC centers (IDRIS in Orsay). It will also be responsible for deploying an academic cloud on this infrastructure. One important aspect of deploying this cloud will be to provide to the life science community virtual machines (appliances) that encapsulate the many complex bioinformatics pipelines and workflows needed to analyze distributed life science data. IFB will make use of its experience in porting applications to distributed computing platforms in leading the project’s “use cases” work package that identifies use cases and validates the project’s software against them.
