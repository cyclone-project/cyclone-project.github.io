title: Energy
teaser: The CYCLONE tools will make it easier to distribute computing resources together with energy resources in order to collect measurement data of energy production and consumption in real time all over the grid.
---
We will use [Slipstream](/software.html#slipstream) to deploy the components of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that integrates distributed energy resources (DERs) for the generation of renewable energy and to combine them to one reliable power plant. We will also use [OpenNaaS](/software.html#opennaas) and [TCTP](/software.html#tctp) to provide tight data security both on the network and application layer.
