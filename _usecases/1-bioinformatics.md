# Use case overview

We use the [CYCLONE software stack](/software.html) to enable advanced cloud management functionality, especially:

* Managing the deployment of single bioinformatics VMs as well as clustered bioinformatics applications through [Slipstream](/software.html#slipstream)
* Relying on federated user identities for data access and data sharing using the [CYCLONE Federation Provider](/software.html#federation-provider)
* Managing firewalling and load balancing network services using [OpenNaaS](/software.html#opennaas)

Within the bioinformatics environment, our developments are used in a wide range of domain-specific applications, for example:

* Cloud virtual pipeline for microbial genomes analysis
* Live remote cloud processing of sequencing data
* Assembling genomes from sequencing reads
