### Joint Sixth IEEE International Workshop on Cloud Computing Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability and Second Workshop on Optimisation techniques for Resource Management and Application orchestration in Cloud Computing 
(Intercloud 2017 & ORMACloud2017) 
<http://www.cyclone-project.eu/intercloud2017&ormacloud2017.html>

In conjunction with the 17th IEEE/ACM CCGrid 2017 Conference on 14-17 May 2017 in Madrid, Spain 
(https://www.arcos.inf.uc3m.es/wp/ccgrid2017/)


### Call for papers 

### SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES	

The workshop is a follow-up of the successful workshop in 2013-2016 (held in conjunction with the IC2E conference), 
where a number of enthusiasts of cloud computing ideas and presented results of research projects dealing with clouds 
and cloud based services infrastructure deployment.  

Advances in processing, communication and systems/middleware technologies have led us to new paradigms and platforms for computing – in the form of Cloud Computing. That in its own turn creates a basis for the Big Data and data intensive technologies.
Cloud Computing is the go-to platform now for datacenter architecture, scalable application hosting, new application development, and mobile applications platform. Growing use of clouds as a platform for modern applications increases demand for cloud automation and consequently better definition of cloud interoperability standards. Security, dynamic trust establishment, SLA management, and other concerns are still active areas of research. This workshop focuses on techniques, experiences and lessons learned for interoperable services in Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability. This workshop aims at providing a forum to bring together researchers for sharing and exchanging Cloud computing related research, technologies, experience, and lessons for building Clouds with Intercloud, Multicloud, Federation, and Interoperability capabilities and services.


The Workshop will have two tracks: Intercloud2017 and ORMaCloud2017. 

### Intercloud topics include (but not limited to) the following:

•	Theory, frameworks, methodologies, architecture for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

•	Cloud Federation and Interoperability Protocols

•	Trust, Security, Identity Management for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

•	Virtual Private Cloud, VPN/IPsec, MPLS techniques for multi-clouds and inter-clouds

•	Theory and experimental results of SDN used for cloud oriented network infrastructure, federations, and interoperability

•	Mobile Roaming applications for for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

•	Cloud and Grid Federation governance, practical experience and regulatory issues

•	Traffic and load balancing across Federated and Interoperable Clouds

•	Multilayer (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) services operation in Intercloud environment

•	Interoperable cloud based infrastructures for Big Data applications

•	Intercloud control and management infrastructure for automated services deployment, management and monitoring

• Cloud Automation platforms and tools for Intercloud, multi-cloud environment

• Zero Touch Provisioning Operation and Management (ZTPOM) architecture and infrastructure components

• Security and Compliance for Cloud based Big Data infrastructures and services 

•	Testbeds for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

•	Different Cloud Platforms tenancy models, such as Private/Hybrid Clouds, Federations, Distributed / Mobile Clouds.
 
•	Specialized and/or very heterogeneous Cloud-enabled infrastructures: Federations, GPU/FPGA augmented Clouds and Edge resources

•	Innovative techniques for service monitoring, modelling and benchmarking 

ORMaCloud2017 topics include (but not limited to) the following:

•	Research  results  and    experiments  on   features  required
  by specific classes of Cloud applications, like Artificial
  Intelligence, Scientific, 24/7  and  Big Data  applications.

•	Algorithms  and   approaches  for  (energy-) efficient mapping,
  scheduling, autonomic and adaptive management of Cloud  resources.

•	Models, algorithms and design approaches focusing on the different
  aspects of resource and application management on Clouds,
  including performance, network optimization, power efficiency,
  security, reliability.

•	Adaptiveness and  autonomicity in Cloud  resource management.

•	Multicriteria  approaches to Cloud  resource management.

•	Innovative techniques  for  application/resource management in
  Clouds, such as AI-based solutions, cognitive-inspired models,
  Machine Learning and  Deep  learning approaches.

•	Cloud  business models and service/resource cost models and their
  interplay with  resource management optimisation.

•	Semantic Web Services Definitions for Clouds Resources and Management

•	QoS/SLA in Federated and Interoperable Clouds

•	Geo-balancing in multi-cloud and intercloud infrastructures 

The workshop will consist of a number of sessions related to two tracks, where recent results of on-going and just-finished research projects will be demonstrated. The workshop will present also some future research considerations on the future of cloud computing 
and networking and expose views from different perspectives: research projects and industry.

The workshop will be followed by a panel discussion, to allow free exchange of thoughts and ideas between the 
workshop speakers and audience.
