StratusLab is a complete cloud distribution that allows you to install an "Infrastructure as a Service" cloud on your own hardware. The StratusLab distribution aims to be simple to use, simple to install, and simple to maintain.

Cloud infrastructures provide many benefits to developers and end-users (scientists and engineers). End-users appreciate the cloud's ability:

* To provide a customized execution environment,
* To make available pre-installed and pre-configured applications,
* To provision new resources (CPU, storage, etc.) rapidly, and
* To allow complete control of those resources.

Application and service developers also appreciate:

* Easy access to the services through simple APIs and
* The elasticity of the cloud to respond to peaks in demand.

StratusLab provides a couple of mechanisms for accessing cloud resources: a command line interface written in portable python and web interfaces (for a subset of services). Developers can also use the Libcloud API, the StratusLab Python API, or the service REST APIs for programmatic access.
