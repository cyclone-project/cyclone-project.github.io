OpenNaaS is an open source platform for provisioning network resources. It allows the deployment and automated configuration of dynamic network infrastructures and defines a vendor-independent interface to access services provided by these resources. OpenNaaS provides support for a variety of resources such as optical switches, routers, IP networks and BoD-domains, but, more importantly, it is easy to add new resources and their capabilities as an extension. OpenNaaS is the outcome of a cooperation between several stakeholders and was born with the goal of creating an open source project fostered by a lively community of contributors, benefactors and beneficiaries. We invite you to join us!
