The Bioinformatics Portal allows end-users without technical background to use Nuv.la for instantiating VMs on the IaaS platform. Just like any other application, the Portal will use OIDCACF for authentication and authorization and could use the network interfaces of the logging middleware. Implementation on these functionalities is currently ongoing. It communicates with the RESTful API of the Deployment Manager in order to deploy and scale applications on the preconfigured cloud of LAL.
