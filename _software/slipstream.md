Slipstream provides many facilities to support multi-cloud application deployment, e.g., it can describe application topologies, connect to different IaaS platform APIs for multi-cloud deployment, and offers a web- and a RESTful interface. It allows end-users to use the OIDCACF for logging in and it can write its log messages to Logstash. Slipstream uses modules to break down application components and uses base images and deployment scripts as an internal application model. Slipstream deployment is highly flexible: any application module can be deployed any number of times to any supported cloud. When deploying applications Slipstream offers further coordination functions, for example, application servers querying Slipstream for the current set of database servers. Appliance and application descriptions can be published and shared between users, providing a "service catalog" that promotes reuse.

Slipstream is a commercial product of SixSq, offered for free through the [Nuv.la Online Application Deployment Plattform](https://nuv.la). However, the core of SlipStream and all of the connectors for open source clouds are released under the Apache 2 license and are freely available. The combination of multi-cloud support, automated deployment, application element coordination, and a user-defined "service catalog" make Slipstream an ideal building block connecting the CYCLONE developments in the cloud layer and those at the application level.
