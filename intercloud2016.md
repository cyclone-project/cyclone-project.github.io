### Call for papers

### Fifth IEEE International Workshop on Cloud Computing Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability (Intercloud 2016)

<http://www.cyclone-project.eu/intercloud2016/>

In conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)
<http://conferences.computer.org/IC2E/2016/>

April 4 - 8, 2016, Berlin, Germany


DEADLINE Paper submission  15 December 2015  

### SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES	

The workshop is a follow-up of the successful workshop in 2013-2015 (held in conjunction with the IC2E conference), 
where a number of enthusiasts of cloud computing ideas and presented results of research projects dealing with clouds 
and cloud based services infrastructure deployment.  

Advances in processing, communication and systems/middleware technologies have led us to new paradigms and platforms 
for computing – in the form of Cloud Computing. That in its own turn creates a basis for the Big Data and Data 
Intensive Technologies. Cloud Computing from Cloud Service Providers is a burgeoning market with a wide variety 
to choose from, including some of the most notable names in Internet and IT today. Cloud Computing is the go-to 
platform now for datacenter architecture, scalable application hosting, new application development, and mobile 
app platform. While cloud Computing enjoys a certain amount of application – or application architecture – portability, 
there are not really any interoperability standards or common practices in place. Security, SLA, and other 
concerns are still active areas of interest. Also, while Cloud Computing is different from Grid Computing, there 
is some Federation and Interoperability in the Grid community, are these appropriate to the Cloud Computing space. 
It is widely believed that the whole space of Clouds, Grids, and the Intercloud will federate and eventually converge. 
There are lessons to be learned from the early Internet work as well as Mobile Telephony. Some believe that SDN is 
the key to making this happen. This workshop focuses on techniques, experiences and lessons learned for interoperable 
services in Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability. This workshop aims at providing a forum 
to bring together researchers for sharing and exchanging Cloud computing related research, technologies, experience, 
and lessons for building Clouds with Intercloud, Multicloud, Federation, and Interoperability capabilities and services.

The Workshop topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

•	Theory, frameworks, methodologies, architecture for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

•	Cloud Federation and Interoperability Protocols

•	Trust, Security, Identity for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

•	Virtual Private Cloud, VPN/IPsec, MPLS techniques for multi-clouds and inter-clouds

•	Grid Federation and Interoperability Protocols, Lessons Learned, As Applied to Clouds

•	Experimental Results of Distributed/Multiple Datacenter Cloud Coordination and Interoperability

•	Theory and experimental results of SDN used for cloud oriented network infrastructure, federations, and interoperability

•	Semantic Web Services Definitions for Clouds Resources and Management

•	Mobile Roaming applications for for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

•	Cloud and Grid Federation governance and regulatory issues

•	Traffic and load balancing across Federated and Interoperable Clouds

•	QoS/SLA in Federated and Interoperable Clouds

•	Converged Implementations of Clouds and Grids

•	Multilayer (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) services operation in Intercloud environment

•	Interoperable cloud based infrastructures for Big Data applications

•	Intercloud control and management infrastructure for automated services deployment, management and monitoring

•	Management operations, discovery, configuration, provisioning

•	Geo-balancing in multi-cloud and intercloud infrastructures

•	Compliance, Reference Definitions and Semantics, for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

•	Testbeds for Interclouds, Multiclouds, Federations, and Interoperability

The workshop will consist of a number of sessions, where recent results of on-going and just-finished research projects 
will be demonstrated. The workshop will present also some future research considerations on the future of cloud computing 
and networking and expose views from different perspectives: research projects and industry.

The workshop will be followed by a panel discussion, to allow free exchange of thoughts and ideas between the 
workshop speakers and audience.
